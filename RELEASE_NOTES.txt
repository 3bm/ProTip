BUG: Bitcoin address not being detected in a Span tag here: https://ploum.net/a-ceux-qui-sont-morts-pour-rien/
This is because the bitcoin address has a ',' after the bitcoin address '12uAH27PhWepyzZ8kzY9rMAZzwpfsWSxXt,' a bitcoin address needs either a space or
end or beginning of a tag container. I have updated the regex to include ',', '.' and ';'
